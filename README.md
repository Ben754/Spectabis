# Spectabis
Spectabis is a free custom frontend for PlayStationÂ®2 emulator PCSX2. Without tinkering for hours with settings for each game or creating complicated setups for each game, Spectabis takes it all from your hands so you enjoy what matters - your games.

You can configure most of the emulation settings, graphical settings, input, sound and manage shaders without leaving Spectabis. Spectabis will handle your game files and appropriate box art covers, connect you to game's PCSX2-Wiki page for even faster and easier game library management.
